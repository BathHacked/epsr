# BAN&ES Environmental Protection Service Requests dashboard

A web based dashboard for exploring [Environment Protection service requests](http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/environment/pollution) made to the B&NES [Environmental Protection Team](http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/environment/pollution#protection).

The data is openly [published to the Bath: Hacked data store](https://data.bathhacked.org/dataset/BANES-Environmental-Protection-Service-Requests/nrff-vhud) and can be accessed, used and shared under an open licence.

This project is based on [a concept](http://hacked.figroll.it/) created at [the Heart The Environment hackday](http://www.bathhacked.org/bath-hacked-loves-the-environment/we-love-the-environment/).
